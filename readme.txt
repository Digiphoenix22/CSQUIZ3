miniMaxSum:

Runtime: 
O(nlogn)

Reason: The most time-consuming operation in this solution is sorting the list of integers, which has a time complexity of O(n log n).

Hackerrankinastring:

Runtime: 
O(n) (Linear)

Reason: The function iteratively checks each character in the string s against the characters of hackerrank. While the function uses recursion, the depth is bounded by the constant length of "hackerrank". The number of operations grows linearly with the size of s, resulting in a linear time complexity.
